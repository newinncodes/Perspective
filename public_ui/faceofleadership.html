    <h3>About this piece</h3>
    <p>The idea for this piece originated in Dec 2022 after I noticed that the executive announcements on my LinkedIn page appeared uniformly male and white</p>
    <p>This fired up my curiosity to analyse the optic diversity of exec teams<sup>2</sup> in the UK tech scene - and represent what I found in a visual way through their faces</p>
    <p>This piece was created in Python + MongoDB + Django; with smatterings of html, javascript and css</p>
    <p>The piece will continually refresh each day as more data is collated into the project and the algorithm evolves</p>
    <p>This is not intended to be a thought-leadership piece on diversity in UK tech.  If that's what you're after, then check out <a href = "https://technation.io/diversity-and-inclusion-in-uk-tech/">Tech Nation's report on Diversity and Inclusion in the UK</a></p>
